# Testing

- This project uses vitest for testing
- Use Vitest for faster testing in Vite-based projects
- Implement the test.each pattern for parameterized tests
- Use the setup files for global test configuration
- Implement mocking for modules and dependencies
- Always create variables with repeated data like id, limit, count etc.
- Always use `test` instead of `it`
- Global mode is enabled so do not import stuff like `test` from vitest
- Don't import describe, test etc. global mode is enabled
